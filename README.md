# Tooth segmentation on pantomogram images - Application - Bachelor Thesis 

## Summary

The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm that can recognize teeth on a pantomogram image. The algorithm is then incorporated into a web application that has a graphical user interface which presents the segmentation results in a user-friendly way.

The approach taken to fulfill this goal is based on watershed segmentation. The algorithm extracts information and transforms the image to maximize effectiveness of the segmentation. The application allow the user to make corrections if the quality of the results is not sufficient.
